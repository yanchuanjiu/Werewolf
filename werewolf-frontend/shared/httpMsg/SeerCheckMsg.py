In Python, there are no direct equivalents to TypeScript's "import", "export" and "interfaces/types", but the functionality can be achieved using Python classes:

```python
from ModelDefs import index
import _httpResTemplate

class CharacterAct:
    pass  # add methods and properties as required

class SeerCheckRequest(CharacterAct):
    pass

class SeerCheckData:
    def __init__(self, isWolf):
        self.isWolf = isWolf
```

Python uses a name binding mechanism allowing for dynamic typing, which is quite different from TypeScript's static typing approach. I've implemented the equivalent classes based on your provided TypeScript code. In the class `SeerCheckData`, `isWolf` is an instance variable which can be a Boolean value. If you want to ensure `isWolf` will only receive boolean values just like TypeScript, you'll have to implement a custom setter method. 

However, if you're looking for static typing similar to TypeScript, you'd better check out typing in Python which began from Python 3.5 version. Python's typing library allows developers to use type hints that tools can use to verify your code. But keep in mind, Python's typing is optional (only hints) and does not affect Python runtime behavior.
