In Python, there are no direct counterparts to TypeScript's 'ref' or Vue.js's 'watch' functions. However, we can mimic TypeScript's ref functionality using simple Python variables. The 'watch' functionality can be implemented using a class that will manually check for changes. Please note that this solution does not provide true reactive programming as vue.js does, but it can behave in a similar way from a certain perspective:

```python
import local_storage

class Watcher:
    """Implements a simple watching mechanism."""
    def __init__(self, initial_value=None):
        self.value = initial_value
        self.last_value = initial_value

    def set(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.check()

    def check(self):
        if self.value != self.last_value:
            self.on_change()
            self.last_value = self.value

    def on_change(self):
        local_storage.set_item("memo", self.value)


memo_watcher = Watcher()

show_memo = False
show_actions = False
show_events = False
show_character = True
can_act = False

# on every change of memo_watcher.value, watcher will call memo_watcher.on_change()
memo_watcher.set("New value")
```

Please note that Python doesn't have a built-in local storage similar to the web's localStorage. You can create one as a dictionary if you don't need storage between different executions of the program, or you could use a package like `smplstorg`(Simplest storage) if you need persistence. In the original TypeScript code, `localStorage.setItem()` is a web API to store data in the user's local system. 

This Python code presumes that `local_storage` is a Python module with `set_item(key: str, value: str)` function which mirrors behavior of `localStorage.setItem()`. You need to implement or import `local_storage` accordingly.
