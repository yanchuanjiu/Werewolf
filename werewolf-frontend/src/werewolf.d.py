The code you provided is TypeScript code used for declaring modules, which is specific to the TypeScript (and JavaScript) ecosystems. Python doesn't have an exactly equivalent concept, but the closest Python analog would be importing a module.

In Python, we can import a library (module) with the `import` keyword. However, Python can't directly handle or import `.vue` files like TypeScript/JavaScript can. It is because .vue files are used in Vue.js - a JavaScript framework - for defining components which can't be utilized using python.

However, if you have a python file with a class "ComponentOptions", you can import it as follows:

```python
from your_python_file import ComponentOptions
component_options = ComponentOptions
```

Here, replace `your_python_file` with the actual python file name where you have the class `ComponentOptions` defined.
