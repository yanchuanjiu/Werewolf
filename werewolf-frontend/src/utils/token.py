Python does not support interfaces like TypeScript and does not have a built-in localStorage like JavaScript, so we are going to use a dictionary and JSON library to replace the localStorage and persist the data in a text file.

Please keep in mind that different use cases will have different data persistence options according to their needs.

Here is the Python equivalent to the given TypeScript code:

```python
import json
import time
import os

KEY = "_werewolf_token_"
TOKEN_FILENAME = 'localStorage.txt'

def set_token(ID: str, roomNumber: str):
    token = {
        'ID': ID,
        'datetime': time.time(),  # Returns the current time in seconds since the epoch
        'roomNumber': roomNumber,
    }
    with open(TOKEN_FILENAME, 'w') as f:
        json.dump({KEY: token}, f)


def get_token():
    if not os.path.isfile(TOKEN_FILENAME):
        return None
    with open(TOKEN_FILENAME, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        token = data.get(KEY, {})

        if (isinstance(token.get('ID'), str) and
                isinstance(token.get('roomNumber'), str) and
                isinstance(token.get('datetime'), (int, float))):
            dt_diff = time.time() - token['datetime']
            if dt_diff / 3600 / 24 < 1:
                return token
            else:
                # TODO remove token from file
                pass

        return None
```
In this code, we write to a file to persist data like `localStorage` in JavaScript, and we read from the file to get the data. We use `os.path.isfile` to check if a file exists. 

We use `time.time()` to capture the current timestamp in seconds. 

The error handling pattern in the `get_token` function in TypeScript has been replaced by the use of `.get()`, a safe way of accessing dictionary values which returns None if the key doesn't exist.

Please note that the lack of typing in Python means that unexpected types can "infect" your data if you are not careful, so validation on your data is important.
