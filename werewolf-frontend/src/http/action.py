NOTE: Unfortunately, thereâ€™s no exact equivalent of TypeScript's promise and an HTTP module with POST requests in Python's standard library. But you could use the `aiohttp` library with async functions to get similar behavior.

Also, Python does not have a direct equivalent for TypeScript's import syntax. You will need to specify the full path of the needed classes and functions in Python.
