Python does not support TypeScript's static typing, and the frameworks used into your TypeScript code like Koa, Http, and Socket.io are also not available on Python. But to perform these web operations you can use frameworks like Flask and Flask-SocketIO. Here is a Python code which implements similar functionality:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, send, emit

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret!'
app.config['CORS_HEADERS'] = 'Content-Type'
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="http://localhost:3000", async_mode=None)

def handle_error():
   # handle error here
   pass

def setup():
    # your setup
    pass

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    handle_error()
    setup()
    socketio.run(app, debug=True, port=3011)
```
This Python code uses Flask and Flask-SocketIO which is a wrapper around the SocketIO, a real-time WebSockets library for Python. As you can see you can use the route decorator to specify the methods allowed on a particular route.

Please note that middleware functionality is handled differently in Flask when compared to Koa. Error handling, and setup functionality should be added according to their respective usage in the original script, and the route '/' should be replaced by actual routes from the TypeScript application.

Remember to install the necessary dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio
```
