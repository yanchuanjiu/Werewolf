In Python, there is no concept of import with curly braces `{}` which is widely used in TypeScript. For translating the following TypeScript code to Python, assuming all modules/classes are available in Python, we can't directly map TypeScript classes, objects, methods, etc. from TypeScript to Python. Hence, preciseness of conversion can't be ensured.

However, some of the conceptual methods, classes from TypeScript code can be implemented in Python. Below is an approximation of the translated code:

```python
from models import Player
from models import Room
from utils import get_vote_result
from . import GameActHandler, Response, start_current_state, status2_handler
from . import WolfKillCheckHandler


class WolfKillHandler(GameActHandler):
    def __init__(self):
        self.curStatus = GameStatus.WOLF_KILL

    async def handle_http_in_the_state(self, room, player, target, ctx):
        if player.characterStatus.wantToKills is None:
            player.characterStatus.wantToKills = []
        player.characterStatus.wantToKills[room.currentDay] = target

        return {
            'status': 200,
            'msg': "ok",
            'data': {'target': target},
        }
    
    def start_of_state(self, room, showCloseEye=True):
        room.currentDay += 1
        start_current_state(self, room)
        if showCloseEye:
            io.to(room.roomNumber).emit(Events.SHOW_MSG, {
                'innerHTML': "Â§©ÈªëËØ∑Èó≠ÁúºüëÅÔ∏è",
            } as ShowMsg)
    
    async def end_of_state(self, room):
        werewolfs = [p for p in room.players if p.character == "WEREWOLF"]
        today = room.currentDay
        votes = [{'from': p.index, 'voteAt': p.characterStatus.wantToKills[today]} for p in werewolfs]
        votes_res = get_vote_result(votes)
        if votes_res is not None:
            to_kill_index = votes_res[0]
            to_kill_player = room.get_player_by_index(to_kill_index)
            if to_kill_player is not None:
                from_indexes = []
                for wolf in werewolfs:
                    if wolf.characterStatus.wantToKills[today] == to_kill_index:
                        from_indexes.append(wolf.index)
                to_kill_player.die = {
                    'at': today,
                    'fromIndex': from_indexes,
                    'fromCharacter': "WEREWOLF",
                }
        WolfKillCheckHandler.start_of_state(room)
```

This is a liberal adaptation as Python does not have direct equivalents for all TypeScript constructs, especially regarding module system, classes and inheritance. Also, async/await are translated directly, but actual implementation would require an asyncio event loop in Python (which is out of the scope of this translation task). I also removed all comments to improve readability.
