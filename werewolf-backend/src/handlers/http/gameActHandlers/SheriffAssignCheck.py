Python does not support types or interfaces like TypeScript does, and there is no explicit `import` method to include files or modules as required. However, you can use classes to design your logic in Python. Take a look at this possible Python implementation for your TypeScript code:

```python
# Assuming "koa", "io", "GameDefs", "ModelDefs", "WSEvents", "ChangeStatus", "PlayerModel", "RoomModel", "getVoteResult", 
# and GameActHandler related functions are methods/modules already defined somewhere in your python codebase, 
# they would look like this:

from koa import Context
from werewolf_frontend.shared import GameDefs, ModelDefs, WSEvents, WSMsg
from models import PlayerModel, RoomModel
from utils import getVoteResult

from . import GameActHandler, gotoNextStateAfterHandleDie, Response, startCurrentState

class SheriffAssignCheckHandler(GameActHandler):
    curStatus = GameDefs.GameStatus.SHERIFF_ASSIGN_CHECK

    async def handleHttpInTheState(self, room: RoomModel.Room, player: PlayerModel.Player, target: ModelDefs.index, ctx: Context):
        return {
            'status': 200,
            'msg': 'ok',
            'data': {'target': target},
        }

    def startOfState(self, room: RoomModel.Room):
        startCurrentState(self, room)

    async def endOfState(self, room: RoomModel.Room):
        gotoNextStateAfterHandleDie(room)
```

The TypeScript code is defining an object `SheriffAssignCheckHandler` that represents a state handler. In the Python code, I've translated that objects into a class with methods that mirror the methods originally provided in the JavaScript object literal. 

Please be careful with the imports as Python works different from TypeScript before use the code.
