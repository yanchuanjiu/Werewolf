Python does not support interfaces or types in the same way as TypeScript. It's a dynamically-typed language. But we can try to translate this code in a way that preserves the functionality:

```python
from . import GameStatus, TIMEOUT, HttpRes, SeerCheckData, index, Events, ChangeStatusMsg, createError, Player, Room, getVoteResult, GameActHandler, Response, startCurrentState, status2Handler, WitchActHandler
from .. import io
from ... import koa

class SeerCheckHandler(GameActHandler):
  curStatus = GameStatus.SEER_CHECK

  async def handleHttpInTheState(self, room: Room, player: Player, target: index, ctx: koa.Context):
    targetPlayer = room.getPlayerByIndex(target)

    if not targetPlayer:
      createError({ 'status': 400, 'msg': '未找到此玩家' })
    if player.characterStatus and 'checks' in player.characterStatus and room.currentDay in player.characterStatus.checks:
      createError({ 'status': 400, 'msg': '一天只能查验一次' })

    isWolf = targetPlayer.character == "WEREWOLF"

    if 'checks' not in player.characterStatus or player.characterStatus.checks is None:
      player.characterStatus.checks = []
    player.characterStatus.checks[room.currentDay] = {
      'index': target,
      'isWerewolf': isWolf,
    }

    ret = HttpRes<SeerCheckData> = {
      'data': {
        'isWolf' : isWolf
      },
      'msg': 'ok',
      'status': 200,
    }
    return ret

  def startOfState(self, room: Room):
    if 'SEER' not in room.needingCharacters:
      return self.endOfState(room)

    startCurrentState(self, room)

  async def endOfState(self, room: Room):
    WitchActHandler.startOfState(room)
```

Note: Python does not have exact equivalents of all TypeScript features, and working with asynchronous code can be very different in Python compared to TypeScript. The provided Python code is a loose translation and might need some rework depending on the actual values/types of the constants/imports and the exact nature of your app.
