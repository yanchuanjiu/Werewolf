Python doesn't have the strict import system as in TypeScript, and the concept of `class` and `interfaces` is handled differently. Below is an equivalent Python conversion for the provided TypeScript code. Here, it assumes that `io`, `GameStatus`,  `TIMEOUT`, `index`, `Events`, `ChangeStatusMsg`, `ShowMsg`, `Player`, `Room`, `renderHintNPlayers`, `GameActHandler`, `Response`, `startCurrentState`, `DayDiscussHandler`, `LeaveMsgHandler` have already been imported or defined elsewhere in your Python code.

```python
# Considering GameActHandler as a base class or similar structure in your Python code, you can use inheritance concept. 

class BeforeDayDiscussHandler(GameActHandler):
    def __init__(self):
        self.curStatus = GameStatus.BEFORE_DAY_DISCUSS
  
    def handleHttpInTheState(self, room, player, target, ctx):
        # TODO 真正设置 isAlive 字段
        return {
            "status": 200,
            "msg": "ok",
            "data": {"target": target},
        }

    def startOfState(self, room):
        if room.curStatus != self.curStatus:
            room.gameStatus.append(self.curStatus)
           
        if room.currentDay % 2 == 0:
            room.currentDay += 1

        dyingPlayers = [p for p in room.players if p.die and p.die.at == room.currentDay - 1 and not p.die.saved]

        for p in dyingPlayers:
            p.isAlive = False

        if room.timer:
            room.timer.cancel()

        if not dyingPlayers:
            io.to(room.roomNumber).emit(Events.SHOW_MSG, {
                "innerHTML": "昨晚是个平安夜",
                "showTime": TIMEOUT[GameStatus.BEFORE_DAY_DISCUSS],
            })
        else:
            for p in room.players:
                p.isDying = False
            for p in dyingPlayers:
                p.isDying = True
            
            io.to(room.roomNumber).emit(Events.SHOW_MSG, {
                "innerHTML": renderHintNPlayers(
                    "以下为昨晚死亡的玩家, 请发表遗言",
                    [p.index for p in dyingPlayers]
                ),
                "showTime": TIMEOUT[GameStatus.BEFORE_DAY_DISCUSS],
            })
            
        startCurrentState(self, room, dyingPlayers)

    async def endOfState(self, room, dyingPlayers):
        if dyingPlayers:
            room.nextStateOfDieCheck = GameStatus.DAY_DISCUSS
            room.curDyingPlayer = dyingPlayers[0]
            LeaveMsgHandler().startOfState(room)
        else:
            for p in room.players:
                p.canBeVoted = p.isAlive
            room.toFinishPlayers = set(p.index for p in room.players if p.canBeVoted)
            DayDiscussHandler().startOfState(room)
```
The code above handles Class methods translated from TypeScript to Python regarding a Game act handler specifically for the event before day discuss. For more complex parts, you might need to define or import code not shown in your typescript snippet, but commonly used in Python applications such as event handlers, timers and other gameplay mechanics.
