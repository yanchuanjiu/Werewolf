Python doesn't directly correspond to TypeScript, also it doesn't have an import system as in TypeScript. But I'm going to show you how we can write something similar in Python. Here I assume that `GameActHandler` is a parent class with some default implementation of functions.

Note: Python has no `const` keyword as in TypeScript. Assume that you have a similar structure of files and imported modules in Python.

```python
from werewolf_frontend.shared.GameDefs import GameStatus
from werewolf_frontend.shared.ModelDefs import index
from middleware.handleError import createError
from models.PlayerModel import Player
from models.RoomModel import Room
from utils.getVoteResult import getVoteResult
from . import GameActHandler, Response, startCurrentState
from .BeforeDayDiscuss import BeforeDayDiscussHandler
from .HunterShoot import HunterShootHandler
from .SheriffAssign import SheriffAssignHandler
from .SheriffElect import SheriffElectHandler

class HunterCheckHandler(GameActHandler):
    curStatus = GameStatus.HUNTER_CHECK

    @staticmethod
    def handleHttpInTheState(room: Room, player: Player, target: index, ctx : Context):
        return {
            "status": 200,
            "msg": "ok",
            "data": { "target": target },
        }

    @staticmethod
    def startOfState(room: Room):
        startCurrentState(HunterCheckHandler, room)

    @staticmethod
    def endOfState(room: Room):
        SheriffAssignHandler.startOfState(room)
```
Please, remember that Python is not TypeScript and the functionality might be different due to the differences in these languages. Check your logic in Python context after conversion.
