Python doesn't have direct equivalent of TypeScript's Modules/imports and Interfaces, but we can refactor the code to make it Python compatible.

In Python:

```python

# assuming we have equivalent python files for the below imports

# from ../../../ import io
# from ../../../../../werewolf-frontend/shared/GameDefs import GameStatus, TIMEOUT 
# from ../../../../../werewolf-frontend/shared/ModelDefs import index
# from ../../../../../werewolf-frontend/shared/WSEvents import Events
# from ../../../../../werewolf-frontend/shared/WSMsg/ChangeStatus import ChangeStatusMsg
# from ../../../models/PlayerModel import Player
# from ../../../models/RoomModel import Room
# from ../../../utils/getVoteResult import getVoteResult
# from . import GameActHandler, Response, startCurrentState
# from .BeforeDayDiscuss import BeforeDayDiscussHandler

class SheriffVoteCheckHandler(GameActHandler):
    curStatus = GameStatus.SHERIFF_VOTE_CHECK

    async def handleHttpInTheState(self, room: Room, player: Player, target: index, ctx: Context):
        return {
            'status': 200,
            'msg': 'ok',
            'data': {'target': target},
        }

    def startOfState(self, room: Room):
        startCurrentState(self, room)

    async def endOfState(self, room: Room):
        BeforeDayDiscussHandler.startOfState(room)

```

Please note that `async/await` syntax is used with Python's asyncio library. If you want to convert this to synchronous code you need to remove `async/await` and refactor the code according to your needs.
