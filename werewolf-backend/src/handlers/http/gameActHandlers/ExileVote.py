Python does not directly support the concept of interfaces or classes with static methods in the way that TypeScript does, so the equivalent definition would use a typical class. However, async functions are also not natively supported and would usually be accomplished using a library like `asyncio`. Here is how you might define the class in Python:

```python
from asyncio import coroutine

from . import GameStatus, ExileVoteCheckHandler, startCurrentState, createError
from ..models import Player, Room
from ..utils import getVoteResult, renderHintNPlayers

class ExileVoteHandler():
    curStatus = GameStatus.EXILE_VOTE

    @staticmethod
    @coroutine
    def handleHttpInTheState(room: Room, player: Player, target: int, ctx: object):
        if not room.getPlayerByIndex(target).canBeVoted:
            createError({
                'status': 401,
                'msg': '此玩家不参与投票'
            })

        player.hasVotedAt[room.currentDay] = target

        return {
            'status': 200,
            'msg': 'ok',
            'data': { 'target': target }
        }
    
    @staticmethod
    def startOfState(room: Room):
        startCurrentState(ExileVoteHandler, room)

    @staticmethod
    @coroutine
    def endOfState(room: Room):
        votes = [{'from': p.index, 'voteAt': p.hasVotedAt[room.currentDay]} for p in room.players]
        highestVotes = getVoteResult(votes)
        # ... Rest of the method goes here
    
```

Note that the above example assumes you have refactored your imports to work with Python, and uses asyncio.coroutine for async calls, you might need to adjust based on your exact needs.
