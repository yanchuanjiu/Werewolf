Python doesn't directly support the concept of interfaces or TypeScript's static typing. You can use the default typing arguments to suggest the type of the argument, but it is still just a suggestion that does not affect the behavior. Below is the Python code which replicates the behavior of the above TypeScript code.

```python
from typing import Optional, Any
from . import GameActHandler, goto_next_state_after_handle_die, start_current_state
from .leave_msg import LeaveMsgHandler
from .sheriff_assign_check import SheriffAssignCheckHandler

class SheriffAssignHandler(GameActHandler):
  cur_status = "SHERIFF_ASSIGN"

  async def handle_http_in_the_state(self, room, player, target: index, ctx) -> dict:
    target_player = room.get_player_by_index(target)
    target_player.is_sheriff = True
    player.is_sheriff = False
    player.sheriff_votes[room.current_day] = target

    return {
      "status": 200,
      "msg": "ok",
      "data": {"target": target},
    }

  def start_of_state(self, room):
    if not any([p.is_sheriff for p in room.players]) or not room.cur_dying_player.is_sheriff:
      return self.end_of_state(room, False)
    
    start_current_state(self, room)

  async def end_of_state(self, room, show_sheriff: bool = True):
    if not show_sheriff:
      return goto_next_state_after_handle_die(room)

    room.cur_dying_player.is_sheriff = False
    next_sheriff = next((p for p in room.players if p.is_sheriff), None)

    if not next_sheriff:
      io.to(room.room_number).emit("SHOW_MSG", {
        "innerHTML": "上任警长选择不传警徽, 现在没有警长了",
      })
    else:
      io.to(room.room_number).emit("SHOW_MSG", {
        "innerHTML": render_hint_n_players("下一任警长为", [next_sheriff.index]),
      })

    SheriffAssignCheckHandler.start_of_state(room)

```

In above Python code, for the import section I assumed that `LeaveMsgHandler` and `SheriffAssignCheckHandler` are present as Python files in the same location. As Python does not support multi level import like TypeScript. Hence, adjustments might be needed for import section in the actual scenario. Please replace methods and variables with actual implementations as per your logic and requirements.
