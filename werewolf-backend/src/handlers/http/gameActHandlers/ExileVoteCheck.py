Python does not have built-in support for TypeScript-like modules or objects but we can create similar modular structure using classes and methods. Here's a Python translation of your TypeScript code:

```python
from werewolf_frontend.shared.GameDefs import GameStatus, TIMEOUT
from werewolf_frontend.shared.ModelDefs import index
from werewolf_frontend.shared.WSEvents import Events
from werewolf_frontend.shared.WSMsg.ChangeStatus import ChangeStatusMsg
from models.PlayerModel import Player
from models.RoomModel import Room
from . import GameActHandler, Response, startCurrentState, status2Handler

class ExileVoteCheckHandler(GameActHandler):
  curStatus = GameStatus.EXILE_VOTE_CHECK

  async def handleHttpInTheState(self, room, player, target, ctx):
    return {
      'status': 200,
      'msg': 'ok',
      'data': {'target': target}
    }

  def startOfState(self, room, nextState):
    startCurrentState(self, room, nextState)

  async def endOfState(self, room, nextState):
    status2Handler[nextState].startOfState(room)
```

This Python version provides the same functionalities as your TypeScript code using Python's classes, methods and import statements. Since Python does not support explicit type declaration, your function parameters are typeless in this version.

Please note that Python does not have any equivalent to TypeScript's async/await semantics. However, Python's `asyncio` package provides similar functionality with its tasks and coroutines system, which is what is used here. You would also have to rewrite your server-side code to use `asyncio` if you were to use this Python version. 

Please be aware that file paths in Python imports can vary based on your project structure, so you may have to tweak them.
