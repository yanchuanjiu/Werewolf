In Python, we don't have classes or frameworks that provide the exact same functionality as the one shown in your TypeScript code. However, we can try to mimic the functionality with classes and methods, taking into consideration Python's syntax, programming paradigm and available libraries. 

Due to the inherent differences between TypeScript and Python, the below translation might not work without adjustment. In Python, we don't import JavaScript libraries such as koa and we don't have the concept of async functions natively. Python also doesn't support optional chaining (like `player.die?.fromCharacter`) so will need some adjustment.

Please install sockets for python using pip:
```
pip install socketIO-client
```
Here's a high-level translation:

```python

    curStatus = GameDefs.GameStatus.HUNTER_SHOOT

    def handleHttpInTheState(self, room: RoomModel.Room, player: PlayerModel.Player, target: ModelDefs.index, ctx) -> Response:
        if player.die and player.die.fromCharacter == "WITCH":
            raise handleError.createError({"msg": "你被女巫毒死, 无法开枪", "status": 401})

        if player.characterStatus.shootAt.player > 0:
            raise handleError.createError({"msg": "你已经开过枪了", "status": 401})

        targetPlayer = room.getPlayerByIndex(target)
        player.characterStatus.shootAt = {"day": room.currentDay,"player": target}

        return {"status": 200, "msg": "ok", "data": {"target": target}}

    def startOfState(self, room):

        shotByHunter = next((player for player in room.players if player.die and player.die.fromCharacter == "HUNTER"), None)
        if not shotByHunter:

            HunterCheckHandler.startOfState(room)


def showHunter(room: RoomModel.Room):
    if "HUNTER" not in room.needingCharacters:
        return False

    hunter = next((player for player in room.players if player.character == "HUNTER"), None)

    if not hunter or (hunter.characterStatus and hunter.characterStatus.shootAt and hunter.characterStatus.shootAt.player > 0):
        return False

    return True
```

Please note that this is a high-level translation and it might not be perfect to fit your need. The goal is to guide you on how to approach handling such a task. If you face any issues you may need to adjust the translation.
