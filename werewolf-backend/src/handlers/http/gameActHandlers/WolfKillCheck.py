Python doesn't have the concept of import or require like in Javascript / Typescript, but you can achieve similar functionality with Python's import statement. Unfortunately, Python does not support importing submodules dynamically from a parent module unlike JavaScript or TypeScript. That being said, if we directly translate TypeScript's file and object structure to Python, many things won't work. Instead, what I'm going to do is to simulate the general logic of your code, including nested functions, to get the closest equivalent Python code:

```python
from werewolf_frontend.shared.GameDefs import GameStatus
from ModelDefs import index
from WSEvents import Events
from WSMsg.ChangeStatus import ChangeStatusMsg
from models.PlayerModel import Player
from models.RoomModel import Room
from SeerCheck import SeerCheckHandler
import io

TIMEOUT = ...  # please define TIMEOUT somewhere since it's not present in provided TS

class WolfKillCheckHandler:
    curStatus = GameStatus.WOLF_KILL_CHECK

    @staticmethod
    async def handle_http_in_the_state(room: Room, player: Player, target: index, ctx: Context):
        return {
            'status': 200,
            'msg': "ok",
            'data': {'target': target},
        }

    @staticmethod
    def start_of_state(room: Room):
        start_current_state(WolfKillCheckHandler, room)

    @staticmethod
    async def end_of_state(room: Room):
        SeerCheckHandler.start_of_state(room)
```
Please note that Python does not have an equivalent representation for JavaScript's object literal syntax which is used in the TypeScript code for `WolfKillCheckHandler`. Instead, I have used a Python class as a equivalent approximation.
