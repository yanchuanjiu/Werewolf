Python does not have a direct equivalent to TypeScript's middleware or "koa". It depends on the web framework you are using in Python. Below is a potential translation using the Flask framework:

```python
from flask import request, jsonify
from .constants import IDHeaderName, RoomNumberHeaderName
from .handleError import createError
from .RoomModel import Room
from .getVoteResult import getVoteResult
from .renderHintNPlayers import renderHintNPlayers

def getWolfs():
    roomNumber = request.headers.get(RoomNumberHeaderName)
    playerID = request.headers.get(IDHeaderName)

    room = Room.getRoom(roomNumber)
    player = room.getPlayerById(playerID)

    if player.character != "WEREWOLF":
        createError({'status': 401, 'msg': "你的身份无法查看此消息"})

    wolfs = [p.index for p in room.players if p.character == "WEREWOLF" and p._id != playerID]

    ret = {
        'status': 200,
        'msg': "ok",
        'data': "",
    }

    if len(wolfs):
        ret['data'] = renderHintNPlayers("狼队友是:", wolfs)
    else:
        ret['data'] = "你没有狼队友"

    return jsonify(ret)
```

Please replace the import paths with the actual paths in your project.

The actual translation depends on many factors and could be different, e.g., it may use Django framework instead of Flask or you may want to handle errors differently. In any case, you would need to have similar functionalities implemented in Python as the ones `Room`, `createError`, `renderHintNPlayers` serve in your TypeScript code.
