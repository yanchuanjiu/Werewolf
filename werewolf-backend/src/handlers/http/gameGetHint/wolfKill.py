In Python, there are no real equivalent libraries to "koa" or the other specific TypeScript libraries used in your code. However, here is a translation in which Particles library is used for managing exceptions and Flask for handling web requests:

```python
from flask import request, jsonify
# The classes, constants and other imports could not be translated since they depend on specific TypeScript libraries
# from method_not_translated import IDHeaderName, RoomNumberHeaderName, index, createError, Room, renderHintNPlayers

def getWolfKillResult():
    roomNumber = request.headers.get(RoomNumberHeaderName)
    playerID = request.headers.get(IDHeaderName)

    room = Room.getRoom(roomNumber)
    player = room.getPlayerById(playerID)

    if player.character != "WEREWOLF":
        raise createError({ 'status': 401, 'msg': "你的身份无法查看此消息" })

    finalTarget = next((player for player in room.players if player.die and player.die["at"] == room.currentDay and player.die["fromCharacter"] == "WEREWOLF"), None)

    data = dict()
    if not finalTarget:
        data["hintText"] = "今晚是个平安夜"
        data["result"] = None
    else:
        data["hintText"] = "今晚被杀的是"
        data["result"] = [finalTarget.index]

    ret = {
        'status': 200,
        'msg': "ok",
        'data': renderHintNPlayers(data["hintText"], data["result"])
    }
    return jsonify(ret)
```

Note: For this piece of code to actually run, you would need to implement `IDHeaderName`, `RoomNumberHeaderName`, `index`, `createError`, `Room`, `renderHintNPlayers` which are imported from specifics TypeScript libraries.
