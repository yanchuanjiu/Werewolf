Although Python doesn't have direct analogs to TypeScript's user-defined error handling and async/await constructs, here is a possible translation for the given TypeScript code:

```Python
import json
from aiohttp import web
import logging
 
async def use_handle_error(request):
    response = None
    try:
        response = await request_next()
    except Exception as err:
        try:
            msg = json.loads(err.args[0])
            response = web.Response(body=msg, content_type='application/json')
        except:
            response = web.Response(body={
                'status': 500,
                'msg': err.args[0],
                'data': {}
            }, status=500, content_type='application/json')
        else:
            response.update({
                'data': {}
            })
        finally:
            logging.error(err)
    finally:
        response.set_status(200)
    return response


def create_error(status, msg):
    raise Exception(
        json.dumps({
            'status': status,
            'msg': msg,
        })
    )
```

Note:

1. I used aiohttp's web framework which is minimalist, easy-to-use, and allows the creation of web servers, clients, and middleware. There are other Python frameworks like Flask, Django that are used more commonly.

2. The term "next" is generally used in context of handling middleware operations. In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to it because Python doesn't exactly have a concept of middleware. However, you can create something similar in Python as a callable object. For simplicity's sake, I have just assumed `await request_next()` would call the "next" middleware or the actual request handler.
   
3. Error objects in Python are exceptions. Exception's basic message is stored into args[0] which is equivalent to the `message` property of Error objects in TypeScript.

4. object destructuring is replaced with individual parameter in python.

5. JavaScript allows us to spread `...msg` an object into the properties of another object. Python instead uses the `update()` method to merge the properties of one dictionary into another.
  
6. As python does not have a implicit return of `undefined`, whenever the `create_error` function is called, it will throw an exception so there is no need to return anything.

7. We can't export functions as TypeScript does, but if these functions are in their own module (i.e., in a .py file), they can be imported by other modules using the import statement as per Python's modules system.
